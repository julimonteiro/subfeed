# Keep README.md Updated

After making changes that affect any of the following, update `README.md` accordingly:

- New or removed dependencies
- New or changed commands / npm scripts
- New or renamed environment variables or config files (e.g. `wrangler.toml`)
- New pages, routes, or API endpoints
- Changes to deployment steps or requirements
- Database schema changes (new migrations)
- Architecture changes (new services, providers, data flow)

Do NOT update the README for purely internal refactors, style tweaks, or bug fixes that don't change usage or setup.
